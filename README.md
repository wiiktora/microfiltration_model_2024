# Microfiltration Model 2024
## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive model for microfiltration processes. The model will simulate the behavior of microfiltration membranes, predict performance under various conditions, and optimize operational parameters.

## Objectives

- Develop a mathematical model for microfiltration.
- Validate the model with experimental data.
- Optimize filtration parameters for improved efficiency.


## Usage

To run the model, execute:
```bash
python run_model.py
```
